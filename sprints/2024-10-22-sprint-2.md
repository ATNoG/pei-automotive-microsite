# Initial MVP

## Sprint Goal

Build a basic MVP with digital twins and map improvements

## Sprint Planning

1. Add APIs for map features (speed limits, etc.)
2. Create a simple digital twin system using Kubernetes, Ditto, and Hono
3. Integrate real sensor data

## User Stories

As a user I want to see speed limits on the map so I know where to slow down
As a user I want the system to be quick and responsive so I have a good experience

## Tasks

- [ ] Improve map with API's
- [ ] Build digital twin system
- [ ] Integrate real sensor data

## Progress

Map API design started
Digital twin system setup in progress

## Challenges

1. API integration complexity
2. Sensor data reliability

## Sprint Review
