# Sprint 5

## Sprint Goal

Initiate the final system, adding more features and improving the user experience

## Sprint Planning

1. Add more features to the MVP, such as Enter/Exit driveway detection and emergency vehicle detection
2. Make a cache system so the system works offline
3. Integration and Analysis of real data
4. Improve sound system

## User Stories

1. As a user, I want to be able to know if I can enter a driveways so that I can avoid accidents
2. As a user, I want to be able to know if there is an emergency vehicle approaching so that I can give way
3. As a user, I want the system to work offline so that I can use it without internet connection
4. As a user, I want the sound system to be in every alert so that I can be aware of the alerts even if I am not looking at the screen

## Tasks
- [ ] Add more features to the MVP, such as Safe Entry/Exit driveway detection and emergency vehicle detection
- [ ] Make a cache system so the system works offline
- [ ] Integration and Analysis of real data
