# Sprint 4

## Sprint Goal

Improve the MVP by adding more features

## Sprint Planning

1. Add more features to the MVP, such as accident alerts and weather alerts
2. Improve frontend and user experience (more details on weather, sound system for some alerts)

## User Stories

1. As a user, I want to be able to know if there is an accident ahead so that I can avoid it
2. As a user, I want to be able to know the weather conditions ahead so that I can prepare for it
3. As a user, I want the sound system to be in every alert so that I can be aware of the alerts even if I am not looking at the screen

## Tasks
- [X] Add more features to the MVP, such as accident alerts and weather alerts
- [X] More details on weather alerts (type of weather, severity, wind speed, etc)
- [X] Sound system for some alerts (accident and weather)

## Progress

- Accident and weather alerts added
- More details on weather alerts added
- Sound system for accident and weather alerts added

## Challenges

Accident alerts with good accuracy are difficult to implement, especially in terms of false positives

## Sprint Review

Every planned feature for this sprint was completed, improving the MVP significantly and making it more useful for users
