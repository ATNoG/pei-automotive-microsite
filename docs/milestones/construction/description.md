# Construction Description

## Context
With the architecture and requirements clarified, the **Construction** phase is dedicated to building the actual system.  
Our team focuses on implementing the main features, integrating different components, and ensuring the system works as intended in real scenarios.

## Goals
The main objectives of the Construction phase are:
1. **Develop and integrate all core functionalities** defined in previous phases
2. **Ensure system reliability and performance** through testing and optimization
3. **Iterate on the user interface and experience** based on feedback
4. **Prepare the application for real-world deployment** and usage

## Expected Outcomes
By the end of Construction, the project should deliver:
- A **fully functional automotive application** with integrated sensor data and event alerts
- **Tested and optimized system components** ready for deployment
- **Documentation and user guides** to support future use and maintenance
