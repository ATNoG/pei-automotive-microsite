# Elaboration Description

## Context
Following the initial analysis and requirements gathering, the **Elaboration** phase focuses on refining the project’s vision and validating the proposed solution  
During this stage, our team improves its understanding of the system’s architecture, explores technical risks, and starts to define the core components that will support the main functionalities

## Goals
The main objectives of the Elaboration phase are:
1. **Detail the system architecture** and select the technologies to be used
2. **Identify and address major technical risks** that could impact development
3. **Develop prototypes or proof-of-concept implementations** for critical features
4. **Refine requirements and use cases** based on feedback and initial experiments
5. **Prepare the team and resources** for the upcoming construction phase

## Expected Outcomes
By the end of Elaboration, the project should have:
- A **validated and detailed architecture** ready for implementation
- **Resolved or mitigated key technical risks**
- **Refined requirements and use cases** for development
- Initial prototypes demonstrating feasibility of core features
