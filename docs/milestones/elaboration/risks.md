# Risks

## Context

This section identifies the **main risks** associated with the development of this project.
This is done since early risk assessment is essential to ensure **realistic planning** moving forward.

## 1. Historical Project Risk

This project has been previously assigned to another student team.
The final outcome of that iteration did not meet the expected quality standards of the tutors, which demonstrates that the project carries an above-average level of complexity.

## 2. Automotive Domain Risk

Automotive applications operate under strict requirements for data precision, stability, and low-latency event delivery.
Failure to meet these constraints may directly compromise the safety of drivers and passengers.

## 3. Technological & Learning Curve Risk

The project involves technologies that were initially unfamiliar to the team, such as:
- Android Automotive OS
- Eclipse Ditto and Eclipse Hono (Digital Twin infrastructure)
- Real-time sensor data handling

This introduces a natural learning curve and increases the likelihood of initial delays, refactoring needs or other mistakes.

## 4. External Infrastructure Dependency Risk

The system relies heavily on external infrastructure provided by ITAv (weather stations, radars, cameras).
Any failure, inconsistency, or downtime in these components can compromise the overall system functionality, which requires some type of fallback system.
