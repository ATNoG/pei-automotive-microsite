# State of Art

## Context

This section presents an overview of existing solutions and technologies that represent the current state of the art in driver assistance and navigation systems. We compare these established systems with our automotive safety application to highlight our unique value proposition.

### Waze

Waze is a community-driven navigation application offering:

- **Real-time Incident Reporting**: Users report and confirm incidents in real-time, creating a collaborative safety network
- **Intelligent Route Suggestions**: The system suggests faster routes when detecting obstacles or traffic on the initial route
- **Community-Driven Data**: Leverages crowdsourced information from millions of users

### TomTom

TomTom is an enterprise-level GPS mapping platform providing:
