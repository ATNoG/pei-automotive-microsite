## Visual Design Principles

Our mockups follow these design principles:

- **Driver Safety First**: All information is presented in a non-intrusive manner to minimize driver distraction
- **Clear Hierarchy**: Critical alerts (speed, hazards) are prominently displayed
- **Accessibility**: Large, readable fonts and high-contrast colors
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Simple controls and familiar navigation patterns
- **Real-time Updates**: All information reflects current driving conditions
