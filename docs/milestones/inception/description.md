# Project Description

## Context
The **Telecommunications Institute of Aveiro (ITAv)** has deployed various types of intelligent equipment, such as **radars, cameras, weather stations, and other sensors** through the region of **Aveiro**.  
These devices continuously collect **real-time data** about environmental conditions, traffic flow, and vehicle behavior.

This infrastructure forms the foundation for **Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)**, which aim to improve **road safety**, **traffic efficiency**, and **driver awareness** through connectivity and automation.  
By integrating this sensor data with vehicle systems, new opportunities arise to **support drivers**, **prevent accidents**, and **enable coordinated maneuvers** between vehicles.

## Problem
Across Aveiro, ITAv operates a large array of sensors that continuously capture valuable traffic and environmental data. There is a clear opportunity to build an integrated application that:
- Collects, analyzes, and distributes these data streams **directly to vehicles or drivers** in real time;
- Delivers **real‑time alerts** about emergency situations such as accidents, severe weather, or traffic congestion;
- Enables **coordination between vehicles**, such as assisted lane changes and cooperative braking.

Realizing this application would turn fragmented feeds into actionable, vehicle‑ready intelligence, allowing drivers to be **alerted in real time**, **assisted by coordination mechanisms** and **helped by the data’s full potential**.

## Goals
Develop an automotive application that leverages ITAv’s sensor network to improve safety and awareness by:
- Identifying and notifying users of emergency events in real time;
- Showcasing traffic status and relevant context around the driver;
- Supporting coordinated maneuvers between vehicles by sharing timely information.

To achieve this, the project will integrate the sensor feeds, process events, and present them through a simple in-vehicle UI (Android Auto/CarPlay compatible).


## Expected Outcomes
By the end of the project we expect to deliver a functional in‑vehicle application (Android Auto / Apple CarPlay) plus a small set of technical assets that make it usable and demonstrable.

### Core capabilities
1. **Directions and guidance** - Turn‑by‑turn navigation to a chosen destination with dynamic rerouting when incidents or congestion are detected.
2. **Adverse weather detection** - Identify rain, fog, wind, or low visibility from sensor feeds and warn the driver with timely, location‑aware alerts.
3. **Accidents and breakdowns** - Detect nearby incidents and indicate safe speed, lane advice, and suggested detours.
4. **Congestion awareness** - Highlight congestion zones on the map, estimate delays, and propose alternative routes when beneficial.
5. **Speed‑limit awareness** - Show the current legal limit (including variable limits when available) and warn on potential overspeed.
6. **Overtaking assistant** - Detect overtaking situations and provide safety suggestions using lane occupancy and speed‑delta cues.
7. **Trip and event logging** - Record anonymized routes and events (timestamps, positions, warnings) for later analysis and evaluation.

We need to integrate the data from multiple sources and provide a clean and responsive interface for vehicle use, so we can develop a functional automotive application capable of assisting drivers with emergency alerts and trafic awareness.
