# Project Description

## Context
The **Telecommunications Institute of Aveiro (ITAv)** has deployed various types of intelligent equipment, such as **radars, cameras, weather stations, and other sensors** through the city of **Aveiro**.  
These devices continuously collect **real-time data** about environmental conditions, traffic flow, and vehicle behavior.

This infrastructure forms the foundation for **Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)**, which aim to improve **road safety**, **traffic efficiency**, and **driver awareness** through connectivity and automation.  
By integrating this sensor data with vehicle systems, new opportunities arise to **support drivers**, **prevent accidents**, and **enable coordinated maneuvers** between vehicles.

## Problem
Although ITAv has deployed a large array of sensors capable of providing valuable information, **there is currently no unified platform or application** that:
- Collects, analyzes, and distributes this data **directly to vehicles or drivers**;  
- Provides **real-time alerts** about emergency situations such as accidents, severe weather, or traffic congestion;  
- Enables **coordination between vehicles**, such as assisted lane changes or braking synchronization.

As a result, the existing sensor infrastructure remains **underutilized**, and its potential to **enhance road safety and traffic awareness** is not being fully realized.

## Goals
This project aims to develop an **automotive application** that leverages data from ITAv’s deployed equipment through Aveiro to improve driving safety and situational awareness.

### Main objectives:
1. **Integrate and process sensor data** collected from radars, cameras, and weather stations.  
2. **Detect and disseminate relevant traffic events**, such as accidents, road closures, or adverse weather conditions.  
3. **Alert nearby vehicles or drivers** in real time to promote safer driving decisions.  
4. **Support coordinated maneuvers** between vehicles by sharing relevant event and traffic information.  
5. **Develop a user-facing application** compatible with **Android Auto** or **Apple CarPlay**, providing an intuitive interface for event visualization and alerts.


## Expected Outcomes
Trought the development of this project, we expect to create:  
- A set of **comprehensive use cases** leveraging the data from ITAv’s sensors.  
- A **detailed system architecture** for data collection, analysis, and event generation.  
- A **functional automotive application** capable of assisting drivers with emergency alerts and traffic awareness.
